## C-Sharp XML-JSON Object Loader

"ObjectLoader" is a fairly light .Net C# project with three object loading methods (for now).

### Project Topic

The objects loading supports the three load data types - Text, XML, and JSON.  
Using the "C# Generic" idea makes the project code very concise and reusable.
